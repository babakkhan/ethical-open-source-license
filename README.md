# Ethical Open Source License (EOSL) v1.0

The **EOSL** is an open-source software license that explicitly prohibits the use
of software in support of genocide, military occupations, and violations of
international humanitarian law. It adds **ethical obligations and liability**
clauses to traditional permissive licensing.

---

## üî• Why This License?
- Prevents software from being weaponized for atrocities.
- Draws on international law (Rome Statute, Geneva Conventions).
- Holds users **legally responsible** for unethical deployments.

# FAQ: Ethical Open Source License

### Q: How is this different from GPL, MIT, or Apache?
Those licenses are ‚Äúpermissive‚Äù or ‚Äúcopyleft,‚Äù but they do not limit unethical
applications. EOSL is a **morality- and law-driven license**.

---

### Q: Is this OSI-approved?
Not yet. OSI has historically resisted moral clauses, but EOSL aims to
redefine what ethical open source means.

---

### Q: How enforceable is this?
EOSL references **international humanitarian law** explicitly, giving stronger
grounds for enforcement than vague morality clauses.

---

### Q: Can I dual-license my project?
Yes. You can publish under EOSL and a standard open-source license to balance
adoption and ethics.
